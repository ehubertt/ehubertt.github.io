        <h1>About me!</h1>
        <img src="images/profile pic.jpg" alt="Picture of me">
        <p>Hello there! My name is Emma Hubert and I am a junior majoring in Finance and Minoring in Computer Science. 
            I am passionate about working in the restaurant industry, as I work part time at 
            <a href = https://californiadreaming.rest/columbia-menu/ >California Dreaming</a>
            as a waitress. I am also very excited about the opportunity to work the Masters Golf Tournament
            in Augsta, GA for the second year as a waitress in a VIP restaurant. 
        </p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Coppell, TX, a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth. I went to Coppell High School
            where I played for the Varsity Soccer team for 4 years. I hope to go back to 
            the DFW after graduation because my best friends and family still reside there. I am 
            looking for a career where I can combine my passion for business and technology. For more 
            about my profession development please visit <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-hubert-7a3932237/">My LinkedIn.</a>
