                            <h2>Kaarin Joy</h2>
                            <p>Kaarin Joy is known for her one-of-a-kind DIY videos on TikTok. I can never get myself to swipe past her videos because everytime she is working on fun and creative projects. She makes everything from chandeliers made of spoons to a toothbrush towel rack. Her page is always exciting to watch! </p>

                            <h2>Yana Ryzhenko</h2>
                            <p>Yana is one of the sweetest and  most creative creators out there! She is always posting makeup reviews and tutorials that you have never seen before. I enjoy watching Yana because she finds eccentric ways to color her face like doing a face full of colored pencils to letting amazon's Alexa pick out all her products. </p>
